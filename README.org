#+TITLE: clojure-utils

* Description
Sadly, much of the existing Clojure ecosystem provides its utilities
only as Leiningen plugins.  This repository attempts to wrap popular
Clojure utilities in a nix flake.

** =cljfmt=
[[https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt][cljfmt]] is a "tool for formatting Clojure code idiomatically".
=clojure-utils= provides a wrapped version that can be used to format
your code using =nix=:
#+begin_src shell
  # Check the formatting of the code under <path-to-source>
  $ nix run github:neshtea/clojure-utils#cljfmt -- check <path-to-source>
  # Fix formatting of the code under <path-to-source>
  $ nix run github:neshtea/clojure-utils#cljfmt -- fix <path-to-source>
#+end_src

Pass any arguments after the =--= that you would pass to `cljfmt`.
Please refer to it's [[https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt#usage][documentation]].
