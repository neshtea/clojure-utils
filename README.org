#+TITLE: clojure-utils

Sadly, much of the existing Clojure ecosystem provides its utilities
only as Leiningen plugins.  This repository attempts to wrap popular
Clojure utilities in a nix flake.  For more information about nix
flakes, please refer to the [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][NixOS Wiki entry on flakes]].

* =cljfmt=
[[https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt][cljfmt]] is a "tool for formatting Clojure code idiomatically".
=clojure-utils= provides a wrapped version that can be used to format
your code using =nix=:
#+begin_src shell
  # Check the formatting of the code under <path-to-source>
  $ nix run github:neshtea/clojure-utils#cljfmt -- check <path-to-source>
  # Fix formatting of the code under <path-to-source>
  $ nix run github:neshtea/clojure-utils#cljfmt -- fix <path-to-source>
#+end_src

Pass any arguments after the =--= that you would pass to `cljfmt`.
Please refer to it's [[https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt#usage][documentation]].
* Goals
The goal for this project is to wrap many of the useful Clojure
utilities as standalone applications.  For some strange reason, many
applications are only available as Leiningen plugins.  Since the
community is [[https://clojure.org/news/2022/06/02/state-of-clojure-2022#_working_with_clojure][slowly moving to other tooling]], it becomes clear that
these plugins must be available as standalone applications.

The current goal is to implement standalone versions of
